## Conflicting Modules
**BetterRolls5e** - Better Rolls 5e uses its own Util functions to handle rolls, and as of writing this note (September 3rd, 2021), they have hardcoded 1 as their crit fail number. They also use a libWrapper with "OVERRIDE" set to the rolls, so there isn't any way (that I've found) to get in there and change the critical fail thresholds, so those two features will not work if you use BetterRolls5e.
